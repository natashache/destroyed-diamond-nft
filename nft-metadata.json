None of this trouble would exist, I thought, if the store-of-value function of these jewelries is transferred to a digital asset.\n\nThat thought inspired me to post this tweet:\nhttps://twitter.com/RealNatashaChe/status/1429576700346748938?s=20\n\nLittle did I expect the tweet to go viral and attract legions of haters. Some people were really upset. I was called all sorts of names.\n\nI decided I needed to do this exercise for real. So I went and bought a real diamond for $5k—> destroyed it—> minted a NFT for the diamond. I wanted to see how much value the NFT retains.\n\nMany don’t understand why this exercise would work, including my mother who is a savvy investor and an accountant for 30 years. I had a long debate with her, which I wrote about here (https://taschalabs.com/nft-is-better-than-diamond-heres-why/).\n\nBut my basic idea is that a physical asset like a diamond has value because of two functions:\n\n1/ physical utilities function\n2/ asset function as a store-of-value (SoV)\n\nWhen you destroy a diamond and create a NFT in its place, you transfer function #2 to the NFT. Since by destroying the diamond, the 1-to-1 mapping between diamond and NFT is cemented, the NFT should retain the SoV part of the diamond’s value.\n\nA NFT can serve the role as a SoV, because it’s able to satisfy 3 basic criteria for something to qualify as an “asset”:\n\n1/ durability\n2/ limit on supply\n3/ social agreement\n\nI also think overtime NFTs will replace physical assets like diamond and real estates, because NFTs are a much more user-friendly asset class for holding and transacting, compared to physical assets.\n\nI explained all the above in more details in this video here (https://youtu.be/rKJNl0lbwUg).\n\nI also estimated how much value the destroyed-diamond NFT should retain, by separating the values of the diamond’s two functions, and adding the NFT’s liquidity premium. See the breakdown here (https://taschalabs.com/how-to-price-a-nft-backed-by-a-physical-asset/).\n\nThere’s so much confusion about NFTs and their role as an asset class. Because it’s challenging people’s traditional assumptions about what assets are and how they work.\n\nI hope this NFT project helps you challenge your own mental framework as well and understand NFT more. Digital assets replacing physical ones is an inevitable trend of this century. You cannot afford to not understand it.\n\nTascha’s Destroyed Diamond NFT Timeline\n\n- Tue, Aug 24 2021, 5:38 PM EST:  Diamond purchased on Blue Nile for $4999\n\nProduct page on Blue Nile: https://www.bluenile.com/diamond-details/LD15766346\nPurchase video: https://youtu.be/rSa1kJ5FI0A\nPurchase receipt: https://taschalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Picture1-4.png\nGIA certificate: https://taschalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Gia-report.png\n\n- Mon, Aug 30 2021, 10:40 AM EST:  Diamond delivered by FedEx to Tascha’s house\n\nDelivery and unboxing video: https://youtu.be/0ZwucY9iC6M\n\n- Tue, Aug 31 2021, 6:13 PM EST:  Diamond destroyed at Modern Auto Body Auto Service Center in Falls Church, Virginia\n\nDiamond destroying process video: https://youtu.be/anzyEtqfA98\nDestroying location: https://taschalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/auto-shop-where-diamond-destroyed-scaled.jpg\nRelics of diamond and its GIA certificate paper: https://taschalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/diamond-corpse-1-1-scaled.jpg\n\nRelevant Resources\n\n- FAQ video: https://youtu.be/rKJNl0lbwUg\n\n- Youtube playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYf5fYPJnU2zLmWDuXQLjQ8AKiXCsYCFy\n\n- Twitter thread documenting the project: https://twitter.com/RealNatashaChe/status/1430248952818028544?s=20\n",
